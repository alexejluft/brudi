# Brudi Assets

Reference files that the AI agent can copy and adapt for new projects.
These are NOT templates — they are starting points that save time and reduce errors.

## /fonts/FONTS.md
Recommended font pairings with download links and `next/font` setup code.

## /configs/
- `design-tokens.css` — CSS custom properties template (colors, spacing, transitions)
- `next-intl-v4.ts` — next-intl v4 config template (middleware, request, routing)

## Usage
The agent reads these files when starting a new project and adapts them to the specific brand/requirements. They prevent common setup errors and save ~10 minutes per project.
