# Philosophy

## Core Beliefs

### 1. Tiefe > Breite
Deep understanding beats shallow knowledge. Know WHY, not just WHAT.

### 2. Anti-AI-Slop
Generic patterns are the enemy. Every design choice should be intentional and defensible.

### 3. Evidence Over Claims
Don't say "done" without testing. Don't claim understanding without proving it.

### 4. Token Efficiency
Skills should be compact. <100 lines is the target. Every line earns its place.

### 5. TDD for Skills
Skills are tested before they're "done":
1. Write pressure scenario
2. Test WITHOUT skill — document failures
3. Write skill that addresses failures
4. Test WITH skill — verify improvement

## What Makes This Different

- **Real Projects:** Every pattern comes from FairSplit, Zouk Website, or similar production code
- **Failure-Tested:** Skills are designed around common failure points
- **Opinionated:** We make choices, not suggestions
- **Compact:** Dense knowledge, not verbose tutorials

## Red Flags

If a skill:
- Sounds like documentation → Too generic
- Has no code examples → Not practical
- Doesn't address common mistakes → Missing the point
- Is over 150 lines → Probably too verbose
